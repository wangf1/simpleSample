        A constructor would typically be used as part of an assignment, e.g.

        However, it's also legitimate javascript to use a constructor without 
        the assignment by just writing new Sandbox() with no assignment.  The 
        constructor does return an object, it's just that it doesn't get 
        assigned to anything so  is discarded.

        We're going to add functionality (methods) to the 'this' object, but 
        rather than returning it, we will pass it to the callback function, so 
        the methods can be used immediately.
